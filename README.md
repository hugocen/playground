# ðŸ§© Playground

A collection of small, random side projects, experiments, and throwaway ideas.  
This is where I mess around with code, test concepts, and try new tools or languages.

## ðŸ§  Purpose
This repo isnâ€™t meant to be organized or production-ready â€” itâ€™s a sandbox for exploration.  
Some of the things you might find here:
- Tiny prototypes
- Quick experiments in new languages
- Reimplementations of existing tools for fun
- Random code snippets that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM

## ðŸ›  Structure
Each folder is an independent mini-project.
